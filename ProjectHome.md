This is a PSP application to read text file, asia script supported(Chinese). it shows TrueType Fonts, users can easily adjust the font size in screen.
It doesn't consume much battery power, it can use as long as around 10 hours with PSP's battery.

It has been released couples years ago, some people seem like.
but later on I stop any supporting works.
Now I decided to release the whole source code.
hope it could be useful for you.


## The application is useful for ##

  * If you want to use PSP to read texts, books for English or Chinese.
  * Font size can be easily changed! this is true type fonts
  * I believe Jap and Kor scripts should be supported but I didn't test it.
  * If you want to use a long working time reader ...


## Source code is useful for: ##

  * Programers interested in PSP programming
  * Programers interested in showing true type fonts for your own program
  * PSP programming techinics like GUI, Memory cache, key reading, analog stick reading, file system access etc
  * If you want to learn how to deal with unicode, Chinese characters, encoding, indexing ...
  * If you want to learn How to say battery for PSP


thanks for free type project, the true type font is supported using their apis
http://www.freetype.org/


## Compile/loadbuild ##

  * use PSP Tool Chain and CYGWIN
  * you must rearrange the directories/path in H files
  * For years I haven't touch the program/code or checked the PSP tool chain, so you might need to change something to compile it
